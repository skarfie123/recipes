# Preparation

This can be done on the same day or the day before as convenient.

1. soak 1 cup rice (2 meals) for 2-3 hours
2. wash the rice
3. add 1/2 cup desiccated coconut
4. grind in blender with water
    - fill the blender ~ half way with 20% water, 80% mixture
    - it should become a smooth but runny mixture
5. add salt to taste ~ 1 spoon
6. add water as needed and mix
7. put the mixture in the fridge

# Frying

1. heat the pan to 8-9
    - prefer stone pan, but non-stick should work
2. spread some oil using a spoon or brush
3. "throw" the mixture on the pan incrementally until it's fully covered
4. cover the pan
5. use the spatula to separate around the border then lift the polo off

# Variations

Instead of desiccated coconut, you can do one of these variations:

- cucumber: 1/2 cucumber sliced
- watermelon 3/4 cup watermelon excess pieces grated
  - not the main fruit but half red and half the white layer between the red and the green
- "mugge": 3/4 cup of pieces grated
