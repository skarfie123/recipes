# Sweet Cucumber Idli

With some of the mixture you can also make sweet cucumber idli

1. prepare/keep some of the same mixture
2. add 1 piece (~1/2 cup) of jaggery (unrefined sugar) and mash in with a pestle
3. put it lower down in the steamer, since it takes longer to cook than the normal mixture
